### ✅ Issues Fixed:
- **React Dependencies:** Added missing `react-dom@^18.3.1`
- **Testing Library:** Upgraded to compatible `@testing-library/react@^15.0.0`  
- **Jest Configuration:** Fixed `moduleNameMapper` typo
- **Mock Setup:** Corrected variable hoisting issues

### 📊 Results:
- **UndoRedoControls:** 17/23 tests PASSING (74% → up from 0%)
