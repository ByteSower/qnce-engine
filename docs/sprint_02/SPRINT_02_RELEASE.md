## 🌟 Key Deliverables

### 1. Performance Infrastructure
```typescript
// Object pooling for memory efficiency
const engine = createQNCEEngine(storyData, {}, true);

// Background processing with ThreadPool  
await engine.warmCache();        // Non-blocking cache warming
await engine.preloadNextNodes(); // Background preloading

// Hot-reload with optimized delta patching
patcher.applyDelta(engine, delta); // <5ms live updates
```

### 2. CLI Performance Dashboard
```bash
qnce-perf dashboard  # Real-time performance metrics
qnce-perf live 1000  # Live monitoring every 1000ms  
qnce-perf export     # Export performance data as JSON
qnce-perf reset      # Reset performance counters
```

### 3. Comprehensive Monitoring
- **Real-time Metrics:** State transitions, cache performance, hot-reload timing
- **Threshold Alerts:** Configurable performance warnings and errors
- **Background Stats:** ThreadPool job queue and worker utilization
- **Export Capability:** JSON output for external monitoring tools
