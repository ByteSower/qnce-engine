## 📚 What's New in Documentation

### 🎨 **React UI Components**
Ready-to-use components for building narrative interfaces:
```typescript
import { useQNCE, UndoRedoControls, AutosaveIndicator } from 'qnce-engine';

function StoryApp({ engine }) {
  const { currentNode, availableChoices, selectChoice, undo, redo } = useQNCE(engine);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <AutosaveIndicator engine={engine} position="top-right" />
      <p>{currentNode?.text}</p>
      {/* Your story interface */}
      <UndoRedoControls engine={engine} showLabels={true} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 💾 **State Persistence**
Full save/load capabilities with automatic backups:
```typescript
// Automatic state persistence
const engine = createQNCEEngine(story, {
  enableAutosave: true,
  enableUndoRedo: true
});

// Manual save/load
const savedState = await engine.saveState();
await engine.loadState(savedState);
```

### ⚡ **Performance Optimized**
Production-ready with extensive optimization:
- **90%+ allocation reduction** through object pooling
- **Sub-3.5ms hot-reload** updates  
- **Real-time monitoring** with `qnce-perf` CLI
