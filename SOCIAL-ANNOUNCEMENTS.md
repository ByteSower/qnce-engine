**QNCE Engine v1.2.0: Quantum-Inspired Interactive Storytelling Framework**

I'm excited to share the first complete release of QNCE Engine, a TypeScript framework for building interactive narratives with quantum mechanics-inspired features.

**Key Features:**
- **Superposition**: Multiple story outcomes exist until player choices "collapse" them
- **Entanglement**: Early decisions affect later story outcomes  
- **Performance**: 90%+ allocation reduction via object pooling
- **React Integration**: Built-in hooks and components
- **State Management**: Full save/restore with undo/redo

**What's New in v1.2.0:**
- Complete TypeScript API documentation
- React UI components (`useQNCE` hook, UndoRedoControls, AutosaveIndicator)
- CLI tools for performance monitoring (`qnce-perf`)
- Production-ready optimization with comprehensive benchmarks

**Quick Start:**
```bash
npm install qnce-engine
npx qnce-init my-story --template react
```

Perfect for interactive fiction, game narratives, educational content, and enterprise decision trees.
