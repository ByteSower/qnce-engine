# Changelog

All notable changes to the QNCE Engine will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

**📌 Current Version: [1.2.2] - 2025-07-05**

## [Unreleased]

### Added ✨
- **Pluggable Storage Adapters** – Unified abstraction for narrative state persistence across environments.
  - Adapters: Memory, LocalStorage, SessionStorage, File (Node), IndexedDB.
  - Factory: `configureStorageAdapter(type, options)` with namespacing + key prefix support.
  - Convenience methods: `saveStateToStorage`, `loadStateFromStorage`, `listStoredStates`, `deleteStoredState`.
  - Metadata listing without full deserialization (where supported).

### Documentation 📚
- Added comprehensive Storage Adapters section to `README.md`.
- New guide: `docs/PERSISTENCE.md` (state shape, adapter usage, custom adapter pattern, best practices, troubleshooting).

### Tooling 🧰
- Introduced dedicated `tsconfig.eslint.json` to scope linting to `src` and `tests` only.
- Adjusted ESLint configuration to prevent build artifacts from triggering parsing errors.

### Internal 🔧
- Minor refactor in core engine to integrate adapter lifecycle cleanly.
- Relaxed some lint rules temporarily (warnings) to prioritize feature delivery; follow-up tightening planned before next tagged release.

### Notes 🗒️
- This Unreleased section will become v1.3.0 (minor) unless additional breaking changes are queued; current changes are additive & backwards compatible.
