## [1.3.1] - 2025-08-25

### Changed üìù

- README updated for v1.3.0 features (qnce-import, persistence adapters, qnce-play storage + non-interactive)
- NPM package republish to ensure accurate README on package page

> Patch release to align public docs with 1.3.0 functionality. No code changes.

## [1.3.0] - 2025-08-25

### Added ‚ú®

- Story import CLI (`qnce-import`) with adapters:
  - Custom JSON (strict/lenient validation with JSON Schema)
  - Twison/Twine JSON (passages, links, robust start detection; tags mapped to `node.meta.tags`)
  - Minimal Ink JSON (developer preview; enable `--experimental-ink` for richer mapping)
- Persistence adapters (Memory, LocalStorage, SessionStorage, File, IndexedDB) with a simple factory
- Engine integration helpers: `attachStorageAdapter`, `saveToStorage`, `loadFromStorage`, `listStorageKeys`, etc.
- `qnce-play` CLI support for persistence backends and a scriptable non-interactive mode

### Changed üîß

- Validation hardening: semantic checks for starting node and dangling links
- Documentation: New wiki pages and CLI docs for import and persistence; examples expanded

### Quality üß™

- New adapter and CLI tests; full suite green across Node and jsdom projects

> This release delivers the Sprint 4.0 scope (Import + Persistence) as version 1.3.0.

## [1.2.3] - 2025-08-16

### Changed üìù

- **Documentation Consistency** ‚Äì Standardized wiki footer/navigation across pages
